- Video 3 - What is Switch, Router, etc...
	- Bus
		- ![[image-12.png|146x69]]
		- called 10BASE5 and 10BASE2
		- needed terminators at end, or else signal will reflect and cause collisions
		- baseband (means only 1 person can speak at a time)
	- Hub
		- ![[image-13.png|144x77]]
		- used UTP cables {unshielded twisted pair} cables, called 10BASE-T
		- have RJ-45 connectors at the end
		- the central hub just flood / replicate traffic out of all ports
		- used CSMA/CD {carrier sense multiple access with collision detection}. old, half-duplex hub networks need this to avoid collisions. works by waiting for quiet line, if collision detected, backoff and wait exponential random time, then try again.
		- Actual throughput of bus and Hub/star networks
			- ( 10 mbps cable ) x (30% after collisions and CSMA/CD overhead) x ( 1/5 number of devices)
	- Bridge and Switches
		- Difference between bridge and switch
			- bridges/switches direct traffic through software/hardware {ASIC circuits}
			- bridges usually only had 2-4 ports
		- Although creates 6 separate collision domains, still 1 broadcast domain
		- Unmanaged switches means you can't change manufacturer's settings
	- Routers
		- switch interfaces forward broadcasts, router interfaces stop broadcasts
	- Firewalls
		- functions:
			- packet filtering/ACLs - based on IP addreses and ports
			- NAT/PAT - can be done by router, but usually by firewall
			- stateful connection - dont recheck ACLs for every packet. knows this packet is part of an ongoing conversation.
		- usually have IDS/IPS inside them
			- IDS sits off to the side via SPAN/mirrored port
			- IPS sits inline
		- can sit behind router or in front of router
	- Access points
		- autonomous access points vs (multiple LWAPs + WLC)
- Video 10 - Build first network in Packet Tracer
	- linux version of `ipconfig /all` is `nmcli device show`
	- how to set static ip in windows:
	  control panel → networking and sharing → change adapter settings → choose ethernet/wifi adapter → properties → scroll down to "IPV4 TCP/IP"
- Video 12 - Switch OS
	- `switch>` the `>` means we are in user mode
	- `enable` = privileged mode. `switch#` 
		- `disable` to exit
	- `?` = show commands
	- if `--more--`, enter shows 1 more line, spacebar shows 1 more page
	- `conf terminal` = enter configuration mode
		- `end` to exit
	- `show mac address-table`
	- `arp -a` = show arp table
		- `arp -d` = delete arp table
	- Simulation mode
		- clear arp table of laptop1
		- show none
		- edit to show ARPs and HTTP
		- on laptop web browser, try to ping server
		- step through simulation and see the arp get broadcast, then dropped at laptop2, and replied back from server
		- then check the arp table of laptop1, see it has learned the MAC address of server
- Video 14 - TCP/IP
	- Application Layer (5/6/7)
		- Protocols: HTTP, FTP, etc
