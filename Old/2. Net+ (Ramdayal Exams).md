	- load shedding - reduce power during peak hours
	- lower gauge cables ↔ thicker wire ↔ lower resistance ↔ higher current
	- NOT CORRECT: surge protectors - only protect 
- NetFlow's analysis can protect agaisnt DDOS
- Vulnerabilities
	- Buffer overflow
		- if input is longer than allocated length, extra characters spill into adjacent memory
		- those extra characters contains remote code execution
		- adjacent memory can contain sensitive data
		- result:
			- remote code
			- privilege escalation
	- Zero day exploit
		- a vulnerability unknown to the public and manufacturer
- CAM table is another name for MAC address table
- DNS filtering = content filtering
- Running Nmap without ip ranges can overwhelm the network
- Internal connectivity OK, external BAD

- PoE troubleshooting
	- make sure switch's PoE budget is not exceeded
	- verify port has PoE config enabled
	- Poe disatance <100m?
	- Plug VoIP phone into another PoE port

	- Traffic shaping - at edge of network (router/firewall)
		- rate limiting - if above limit, wait in buffer then released smoothly
		- policing - if above limit, drop
	- Packet scheduling - at switch or router, which goes next to interface
		- types: WFQ, PQ
		- example: real-time video streaming > non critical data
- Transport agnostic networking
	- layer 3 packets dont need to know about what type of medium they are going to on layer 2 (ethernet, wifi, cellular)
		- advantages: flexible, scalable, future proof to new devices
		- disadvantages: initial setup more complex and plannign
- *NAT makes direct P2P difficult*
	- *unsolicited inbound traffic doesnt know where to go*
	- *port forwarding rules fixes this*
- PSK vs Enterprise authentication
	- both are part of wireless authentication in WPA2/WPA3
	- personal = single static password
	- enterprise = each user has own credentials
		- uses a deidcated autehtnication server with RADIUS
- Wrong voltage dangers
	- too high - overheat/burn/short circuit
	- too low - erratic behavior, data corruption, shortened lifespan
- DHCP options
	- everything except main stuff (server and scope) - def gateway, dns server
- NIDS another name for IDS
- Trojans vs Spyware
	- trojans sudden, large amount of data
	- spyware slow and over time
- if you connect a 802.3at phone to a 802.3af switch, it will work, but lose power intermittently
- Telnet uses plaintext passwords
- *3-tier hierachal model*
	- *access layer: connects end devices, VLANS to segment netowrk*

- cloud: elasticity is automatic+short term. scalability is long term
- collapsed core = core+distribution layer combined
- forward DNS zone = A and AAAA records
- PCI DSS = payment card industry data security standards
- *ports*
	- *down = by administrator*
	- *suspended = misconfigured*
	- *blocking = by STP*
- *NSL = network security list = list of policies*
- DAC cables = direct attach copper cables = twinaxial cables with built in transceivers
- *what is AS in routing protocols? collection of networks and routers under a common administration*
- *VTP = VLAN management, dynamically manages VLANcreation, deletion, renaming*
- WPA2 uses AES, while WPA used TKIP which is less secure
- TACACS vs RADIUS - TACACS encrypts entire auth process, RADIUS only encrypts the password
# Mistakes I Made
- *VLAN tagging is done at layer 2 (data link)*
- *NICs are part of BOTH layer 1 (physical) and layer 2 (data link)*
- *FHRP*
	- *devices point default gateway to a virtual IP*
	- *when a router fails, that virtual IP switches to a different router*
- *the boundaries of subnets are routers, the bounaries of ??? are switches*
- Packet capture
	- network taps - network must be temporarily off to install physically
	- port mirroring - least efffect on network performance, can sitll oversubscript the monitoring port
	- firewall w packet capture capabilities - degrades firewalls performance, whose primary purpose isnt packet capture
	- software - degrades the device's performance
- *Honeypot is only a single device, as opposed to honeynet*
- antiviruses cant stop DOS attacks, because traffic content is legitimate, just overwhelming in volume
- Security options
	- enable BDPU guard - prevents rogue switches from being added into STP
	- *Disable DTP on switch ports - dynamic trunking protocol automatically figures out if a swithc port should be access mode (single VLAN / end device) or trunk mode (multiple VLANs / connecting to another switch)*
		- *prevents switch snooping*
	- DHCP Snooping - passively listens to all DHCP conversations on the network and builds a trusted databse of IP-to-MAC mappings.
		- prevents ARP poisoning if used with DAI (aka drop all invalid ARP packets)
	- port security / limit # of devices allowed per port
		- prevents MAC spoofing
	- Mac filtering only detects the violation, shutdown violation mode is the consequence 
- *connectivity issues in a certain section of building rules out network congestion, but EMI intereference has to do with physical location*
- *Alternate Port*
	- *in STP, its a backup path, currently in blocking mode*
- *STP ports*
	- *alternate port - redundant path to root, in blocking*
	- *backup port - redundnat path to another network segment, also in blocking*
- DNSSEC is only integrity, not encryption
- *ACLs are about "what" traffic can move, not "who" can do what*
- Symptoms
	- *consistent* high latency = congestion, not physical problems like improper cable termination
	- *total* network failure = not just a problem with 1 cable, such as improper termination
	- intermittent connectivity = signal disrupted by small movements, small EMI, or temperature change
- Giant frames
	- cause 1: MTU size incorrect
	- cause 2: bad NIC
	- cause 3: damaged cables
- NAT gateway is not a networking concept, it is a service option provided by cloud providers
	- "we'll handle the NAT server for you, you dont need to manage the instance"
- PaaS does not eliminate need for development, just has helpful development tools and services. 
- *Ad hoc vs Infrastructure*
	- *ad hoc - devices directly connect to each other*
	- *infrastructure - all devices connect to central point*
- RTT = round trip time = latency
- Bitlocker encrypts entire drives
- air gapped networks prevent lateral movement of intruders
- 802.1x means enterprise security, not personal
- *port not forwarding traffic + mac addresse tabel growign = learning*
- *probe + generator*
	- *does not test continuity.*
	- *no signal could also be a short circuit, not just open circuit*
	- *no signal doesnt tell you which wire is not working*
- *SVI switched veritual interface*
	- *when router and switch are separate, separate interfaces assigned to different VLANs. But if switch and router combined, we need those interfaces to be virtualized to route VLAN specific traffic.*
- *Band steering usually means forcing 5Ghz when 2.4Ghz available*
- DHCP relay agents
	- needed when client and DHCP server on diff subnets
- RADIUS
	- centralized authentication
- Risk assessment is only gathering information, not putting protection and aactions in place
	- identify threats, evaluate impact, determine likeliehood
- HSM 
	- hardware security module
- *LC - pushpull latch, SC = push pull. ST = bayonet*
- DCI = data center iterconnect.c an be dedicated physical line
- *BGP = between diff autonomous systems. OSPF/EIGRP = within single AS*
- *RIP uses hop count as distance metric*
- *subinterface = dividing physical interface into multipel virtual interfaces*
- *antennas*
	- *parabolic - long-distance like satellite*
	- *yagi - medium-distance, like rooftop wifiand tv*
	- *patch - short, like wifi routers and GPS*
- PDUs: more imrpotant: remote monitoring + control > surge protection
- intermittent slowdowns? --> do real-time packet capture during slowdowns
- RADIUS = centralized authen, authoriz, accounting
	- TACACS is same as RADIUS without encryption
- MDM = mobilde device management. needed for BYOD 
- *Vlan hopping? disable DTP (dynamic trunking protocol)*
- *ACLs not working? check order first.*
- *describe BNC connector = twist on bayonet*
- LLDP - layer 2 devices advertising their existence out to all directly connected neightbors at regular intervals

# Test taking principles
- If asking "first" thing to do in trouble shooting, always choose information gathering
	- what do you see?
	- what were you doing?
	- when did it start?
	- VERIFY x
- Application taking up too much bandwidth
	- analyze all things related to application itself first (app settings) before investigating anything network related
- "Importance" / "Key function" questions
	- encryption > compression
- "Strategies" / "best practices" questions
	- "Gradually..." > "third party" / "escalate..."
	- Physical changes to network usually considered last resorts / expensive options
- Physical damage to components > performance degradataions, lifespanreductions
- PKI + digital certificates > IKE/diffie hellman
- security at router interface > security at the server/switch level
- first step: review settings/config > asking users to do something, physically doing something
- first step: words like "identify" and infomration based knwoledge gathering
- WPA2 and WPA3 do not use digital certificates, instead use shared keys or passwords
- if its asking "best practice" / "most effective" answer with "centralized" is best
- EOS application → close unusued ports and disable services
- "sporadic" problems → not related to peak times
- "effective strategy?" → anything that is manual or introduces chances of human error = bad
- troubleshooting "despite multiple adjustments". what to do next? escalate

Whenever teaching me a concept in IT or cybersecurity, here are my instructions on how I would like to be taught:
1. Focus on teaching me how the concept sits in hierachal relationship to other concepts. Example 1. I learned separately about Ethernet, Wi-fi, PPP, IPv4, IPv6, ARP, CDP and LLDP all as separate singleton topics long before I realized their hierachal relationship to each other. It turns out that all frames are going to be either 1️⃣ ethernet frames 2️⃣ wifi frames or 3️⃣ PPP frames. Then ethernet frames can furher be subcategorized into ethertypes of 1️⃣ ipv4 2️⃣ ipv6 3️⃣ ARP  4️⃣ CDP 5️⃣ LLDP 6️⃣ pause frames. Where a concept's relationship is to other concepts in the grander birds-eye view of this certification is just as important to me as the definition and details of a concept viewed in isolation. Example 2. I was first taught that VPN uses GRE and IPSec and IKE and Diffie-Hellman and has authentication, integrity, and encryption. Instead, I want to be taught that VPN uses (1) GRE to create the tunnel and (2) IPSec to secure the tunnel. Then IPSec contains 2 planes (2A) the management plane, handled by IKE and (2B) the data plane. the management plane performs (2Ai) authentication and integrity checks via RSA + PKI, and (2Aii) creation of a secret shared key via diffie-hellman. the data plane performs (2Bi) authentication and integrity checks via HAMC and the secret shared key established in prior plane, and (2Bii) encryption via AES. In short, I don't want to be just taught what a concept is in isolation, teach me its relationship to other concepts.
2. Whenever teaching me a new concept X, add the following information whenever applicable: 1️⃣ Troubleshooting situations in which X is likely the culprit 2️⃣ When X is improperly set up / disabled / not being used, these are the symptoms / network behaviors / vulnerabilities to result. 3️⃣ When X is a network design choice / configuration option / optional device to use on a network / any concept which has alternatives, compare X to its alternative choices or compare X to the choice to not use X at all, and highlight advantages and disadvantages 4️⃣ show me situations in which using choice X is the solution to a scenario 4️⃣ show me 2-3 example MCQ questions which have concept X in the question or as one of hte answer choices, questions which test beyond simple definitions. These themes are all designed to prepare me for the typical types of questions which are tested by CompTIA exams beyond simply knowing their definition.
