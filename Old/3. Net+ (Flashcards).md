	- What is EIGRP? Cisco's proprietary OSPF. hybrid between link-state and distance-vector. main feature is load-balances even over higher-cost routes
	- what is OSPF? open source link-state routing protocol. best route takes into account bandwidth of each path. can load-balance between equal-cost routes (called ECMP equal cost multiple paths)
	- how is OSPF built up? routers flood LSA (link-state advertisements) every 30m (or when a change) to all other routers (not just direct neighbors), and each router recalculates djikstras on entire topology.
	- how is RIP built up? routers periodically sned their routing table every 30s ONLY to their direct neighbors. 
	- what is BGP? also myopic and decntralized like RIP. instead of advertising ip addresses to direct neighbors, advertises IP ranges, along with the AS required to pass through to get there. Takes into account business and legal policies to determine "best" paths. 
	- Cisco route codes in routing tables? C (0 - directly connected) L (routers own address) S (1 - static), D (90 - EIGRP), O (110 - OSPF), R (120 - RIP), DHCP (254)

	- what is ipv6 4in6? a tunnel method which is rare because usually the challenge is crossing older infrastructure which only supports ipv4
	- what is ipv4 dual-stack? every device and router from beginning to end have both ipv4 and ipv6 addresses. 
	- what is ipv6 translation? uses NAT64 and DNS64 to map ipv6 to a ipv4 address +port so that ipv6 devices can use older ipv4 services.
	- what is SLAAC? ipv6 devices dont require a DHCP server, they assign themselves a ipv6 addresss. network prefix + MAC address (with `ff:fe` in the middle + flip 7th bit)
	- in ipv6, What is DAD? duplicate address detection. send out NS (neighbor solicitation) to `ff02::1:ffXX:XXXX` using last 24 bits, a multicast group for all addresses ending in 'XX:XXXX' are subscribed to. if conflict, they reply with NA (neighbor advertisement)
	- in ipv6, what is RS/RA? router solicitation and advertisement. replaces DHCP. `ff02::2` is a fixed multicast group address that all routers are subscribed to. hosts send RS to that address to find routers. 
	- who assigns the DHCP For the entire network? the DHCP
	- what happens if a subnet mask is too short? mistakenly sees destinations as internal, ARP broadcasts to find a destination, finds none, drops
	- what happens if a subnet mask is too long? mistaken sees destinations as external, sends packets which should go locally to default gateway
	- can reach some local hosts, but not others. is subnet mask too long or too short? too short. because i am trying to send to non-existent local hosts
- VLANs
	- how do VLANs work? switch ports are each assigned to exactly 1 VLAN, creating separated layer2 broadcast domains.

	- what is SVI? switched virtual interface. Inter-VLAN routing done internally by a Layer 3 switch via virtual interfaces for each VLAN. scale better than router on a stick. 
	- What is native VLAN? for each trunk, 1 particular VLAN is designated as the native VLAN, and that traffic when sent across trunks, instead of having its particular tag, is sent untagged.
	- What are subinterfaces? between a switch and a router, if we have multiple VLANs, we need a separate cable for every VLAN. subinterfaces allow a single router to be the default gateway for multiple VLANs simultanesouly.
	- How to deal with voice and data contention? separate them into VLANs
	- on switches, what are access ports? belong to single VLAN, connect to end-devices, only send and receive untagged frames EXCEPT some ports accept frames with native VLAN tag. incoming: add VLAN Tag. outgoing: strip VLAN tag.

	- What determines cost to the root bridge in STP? bandwidth. 10mb/100mb/1gb/10gb = 100/19/4/2 cost 
	- In STP, how does a switch determine designated ports vs non-designated/blocking ports? listen to neighbors BDPUs. If a neighbor advertises a better path to the root, your port facing that neighbor is Blocking. if a neighbor advertises a worse path to the root, your port facing that neighbor is designated/forwarding.
	- What are the listening/learning/forwarding states in STP? 15s each. first only listening BDPUs. then add in learning MACs. then add in forwarding traffic
	- What is discarding state in RSTP? combined blocking + listening + disabled states
