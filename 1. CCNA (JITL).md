## Interfaces and Cables
- 802.3 = Ethernet
- Ethernet cables
	- AKA "Twisted-pair cables" AKA "UTP/STP" AKA "Copper straight-through" (packet tracer)
	- Electric signals
	- maximum length = 100m
	- 10BASE and 100 Base pins (only uses 4/8 wires)
		- Straight-Through
		- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20251003021314.png|260x100]]
		- Crossover
		- ![[image-14.png|268x100]]
		- Switches are the only devices who transmit on 3/6 and receive on 1/2
		- Auto MDI-X means we dont have to worry about using straight-through or crossover
	- 1000BASE and 10GBASE
		- Every pair is bi-directional
		- ![[image-15.png|210x102]]
- Fiber Optic
	- For distances over 100m
	- Light signals
	- Require a transceiver to plug into port
	- MMF vs SMF
		- MMF cheaper
			- bc LED transceivers vs Laser transceivers
		- SMF longer distances

## OSI Model & TCP/IP
- in packet tracer
	- G on interface = "gigabit ethernet"
	- F on interface = "fast ethernet"
- Misunderstandings
	- devices are not members of networks, their interfaces are
	- devices dont have IP addresses, their interfaces do

## Cisco IOS CLI
- Rollover cable (serial ↔ rj-45) + Console port + PuTTY (connection type: serial)
- `>` = exec mode
- `#` = privileged mode
	- `enable`/`disable` = enter/exit
	- `show running-config` / `sh run`
	- `show startup-config`
	- `write` / `write memory` / `copy running-config startup-config` = save as startup-config
- `?` = see available commands
- `configure terminal` / `conf t`= enter configuration mode
	- `exit` = exit global conf mode
	- passwords
		- `enable password password_here`
		- `service password-encryption` = dont display password, but weak
			- `no service password-encryption` = dont encrypt future passwords, but already encrypted passwords will remain
		- `enable secret password_here` = dont display password, stronger
	- `do` = privileged mode commands while in config mode
	- `no` = disables a command which is turned on
	- `hostname host_name_here` 

## Ethernet LAN Switching
- Ethernet frame header and trailer
	- Preamble (7) and SFD (1) - synchronization / start parsing here
	- Destination and Source MAC (6)
	- EtherType (2) - what is the type of PACKET is the PAYLOAD.
	- FCS (4) - Data integrity check
		- ethernet FCS: more robust, integrity of headers AND payload
		- ipv4 checksum: basic, integrity of the packet headers ONLY
		- tcp/udp checksum: basic, integrity of the segment headers AND payload
	- frame is minimum 64 bytes
- MAC addresses
	- first 6 hexadeciaml are the OUI (aka manufacturer)
	- packet tracer wants this format: AAAA.BBBB.CCCC
	- dynamic MACs are removed from mac address-table after 5 minutes of inactivity
	- mac address-table: maps MAC → egress interface
	- `show mac address-table`
	- `clear mac address-table dynamic`
- ARP
	- arp table: maps local IP addresses → mac addresses
		- PCs: `arp -a`
		- CISCO devices: `show arp`
	- arp request: Destination MAC = FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
		- when router receives FFFF.FF... → flood
		- when host receives FFF.FF.... → check if dest IP matches my own IP
			- yes? send ARP reply
			- no? drop
	- ping always sends 5 ICMP echos. 
		- the first 1/5 may fail if MAC unknown, so needs to do an ARP
- Packet tracer quirk:
	- 'noise' like CDP frames every 60 seconds and BDPU frames are not shown


| Class | 1st octet | def mask (dec) | def mask (cidr) |
| ----- | --------- | -------------- | --------------- |

| E     | 240+      |                |                 |

## IPv4 addresses
- 2 hex = 1 byte = 8 bits
- SWITCH: manually setting IP addresses
	- [router#] `show interfaces g0/0` details of 1 interface
	- [router#] `show ip interface brief` shows ip address per interface
		- `do sh ip in br` from config mode
		- status column: admin down / cable unplugged (Down) / both ok (Up)
		- protocol column: down = bad cabling or other side down. up = working
	- [router(config)#] `interface g0/0` = enter configuration for a specific interface
	- [router(config-if)#] `ip address x.x.x.x y.y.y.y` = set the ip address and subnet mask
	- [router(config-if)#] `no shutdown` = switch on a administratively down interface
	- [router(config-if)#] `desc text goes here` = add human readable description
- ROUTER: manually setting IP addresses
	- [switch#] `show ip interface brief` still works here
		- use this for ip, status, and protocol
		- switch interfaces are up by default, whereas router interfaces are admin down by default
	- [switch#] `show interfaces status`
		- use this for vlan, duplex, speed
	- [switch#] `show interfaces` / `show interfaces g0/1` 
		- use this to show errors
	- [switch(conf)#] `interface f0/1` / `interface range f0/1 - 5`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `speed ?` / `speed 10` / `speed 100` / `speed auto`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `duplex auto` / `duplex full` / `duplex half`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `desc textGoesHere`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `shutdown` / `no shutdown`
- Duplex
	- devices connected to hubs must use half-duplex
	- auto-negoatiate: will set half for 10/100 mbps, but full for 1000 mbps
	- CSMA/CD = avoids collisions on half-duplex

## IPv4 Headers
- Version (4) - 4 or 6
- IHL - header length 
	- Usually just 5 which means "no optional headers"
- DHSCP - QoS flags
- ECN
	- congested receiving router marks incoming L3 packets with ECN=11 "i'm congested!"
	- receving host marks replies with L4 TCP segments with ECE=1 "slow down!"
	- sending host marks subsequent L4 TCP segments with CWD=1 "understood, slowing down!"
- Total Length (headers+payload)
	- min 20
	- max 65,535
- Identification - The original segment which this is fragment belongs to
	- MTU = 1500 bytes
	- can be 1,2,3... or completely randomized for security
- Flags
	- 000 = unfragmented, but allowed
	- 010 = unfragmented, not allowed
	- 001 = fragmented, with more to come
	- 000 = fragmented, last one
- Offset
	- where this fragment belongs in the original datagram
	- divided by 8 bytes to save space
- TTL
	- routers drop if TTL=0
	- TTL is hopcount, decreased by 1 at every router.
	- recommend default TTL is 64
- Protocol
	- TCP (6)
	- UDP (17)
	- Control: ICMP (1), IGMP
	- Routing protocols: OSPF (89), EIGRP
	- VPN/tunneling: GRE, ESP, AH
- Header checksum
- Source IP
- Destination IP

## IPv4 Routing
- WAN = think of a set of routers
- host IPs vs network IPs
	- host IPs = 192.168.1.N, some host bit
	- network IPs = 192.168.1.0, host bit is 0
		- can be an entire LAN
		- can be just the p2p link between 2 routers
- [router#] `show ip route` = show routing table
- When you set IP adress on any interface (`interface g0/1` → `ip address nnn.nnn.n.h\24...` → `no shutdown`) you always get 2 entries added to routing table
	- `C nnn.nnn.n.0\24` = any address of sharing same network address, dont look for next hop IP, go straight to ARP table
	- `L nnn.nnn.n.h\32` = here to route to myself

## Static routes
![[image-16.png|446x90]]

|                              | Destination                                    | Next Hop                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| entry on R1's routing table: | to reach blue network<br>192.168.**4.0**/24    | the next hop is blue IP<br>192.168.**13.3**/24 |
| entry on R4's routing table: | to reach the red network<br>192.168.**1.0**/24 | the next hop is red IP<br>192.168.**34.3**/24  |

- [Router(config)#] `ip route [destination-ip] [subnet mask] [next hop ip]`
	- the entry will have `S` for static
- [Router(config)#] `ip route [destination-ip] [subnet mask] [exit interface]`
	- good for p2p connections between routers, but may create unnecessary ARP traffic if that exit interface leads to multiple subnets
- Default gateway is just when destination IP = `0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0`
	- its just the least specific route possible

## Troubleshooting
- on PC: check `ipconfig /all`
- on PC: try `ping default-gateway`
- on router: check interfaces with `show ip int brief`
- on router: check routing table with `show ip route`
	- cancel a static entry: `no ip route...`

## Subnetting

| binary   | decimal | CIDR | block size |
| -------- | ------- | ---- | ---------- |
| 10...    | 128     | + /1 | 128        |
| 110...   | 192     | + /2 | 64         |
| 1110...  | 224     | + /3 | 32         |
| 11110... | 240     | + /4 | 16         |

- how to calculate subnet address
	- from weird octave, find block size.
	- keep adding block size to self until exceeds
- `/30` is best subnet mask for p2p networks betwene 2 routers

- subnet1: 192.168.5.0/25
	- pc1: 192.168.5.1  255.255.255.128
	- r1 interface: 192.168.5.126 255.255.255.128
- subnet2: 192.168.5.128/26
	- pc2: 192.168.5.129 255.255.255.192
	- r2 interface: 192.168.5.190 255.255.255.192
- subnet3: 192.168.5.192/28
	- pc3: 192.168.5.193 .240
	- r3: 192.168.5.206 .240
- subnet4: 192.168.5.208/28
	- pc4: 192.168.5.209 .240
	- r4: 192.168.5.222 .240
- subnet5: 192.168.5.224/30
	-  for 2 P2P interfaces

- purpose of subnetting
	- grouping hosts by shared network bits (instead of say sequentailly) so the route to them can be collectively listed as a single entry in routing table
	- packets to other hosts in same subnet do not need to go up to router. can directly ARP / only go to the switch
## VLANs
- LAN = single broadcast domain (dest MAC = FFFF.FFFF.FFFF)
- cuts down on broadcast traffic
	- ARP, DHCP DOTA, STP BDPUs, CDP/LLDP, IPv6 neighbor discovery (AKA ARP)
		- ARP 2-5 minute timeout
		- DHCP renew least halfway through 12 hour lease default
		- BDPU is every 2 seconds  per switch port (and also per VLAN for trunk ports)
		- CDP every 60s, LLDP every 30s
- VLANs are configured on SWITCH interfaces. the host has no idea what VLAN its on
- `show vlan brief`
- `vlan 10` → `name name_here`
- `interface range g1/0 - 3` → `switchport mode access` → `switchport access vlan 10`
- there are always 5 default vlans (4 are deprecated)
