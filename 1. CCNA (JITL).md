## Interfaces and Cables
- 802.3 = Ethernet
- Ethernet cables
	- AKA "Twisted-pair cables" AKA "UTP/STP" AKA "Copper straight-through" (packet tracer)
	- Electric signals
	- maximum length = 100m
	- 10BASE and 100 Base pins (only uses 4/8 wires)
		- Straight-Through
		- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20251003021314.png|260x100]]
		- Crossover
		- ![[image-14.png|268x100]]
		- Switches are the only devices who transmit on 3/6 and receive on 1/2
		- Auto MDI-X means we dont have to worry about using straight-through or crossover
	- 1000BASE and 10GBASE
		- Every pair is bi-directional
		- ![[image-15.png|210x102]]
- Fiber Optic
	- For distances over 100m
	- Light signals
	- Require a transceiver to plug into port
	- MMF vs SMF
		- MMF cheaper
			- bc LED transceivers vs Laser transceivers
		- SMF longer distances

## OSI Model & TCP/IP
- in packet tracer
	- G on interface = "gigabit ethernet"
	- F on interface = "fast ethernet"
- Misunderstandings
	- devices are not members of networks, their interfaces are
	- devices dont have IP addresses, their interfaces do

## Cisco IOS CLI
- Rollover cable (serial ↔ rj-45) + Console port + PuTTY (connection type: serial)
- `>` = exec mode
- `#` = privileged mode
	- `enable`/`disable` = enter/exit
	- `show running-config` / `sh run`
	- `show startup-config`
	- `write` / `write memory` / `copy running-config startup-config` = save as startup-config
- `?` = see available commands
- `configure terminal` / `conf t`= enter configuration mode
	- `exit` = exit global conf mode
	- passwords
		- `enable password password_here`
		- `service password-encryption` = dont display password, but weak
			- `no service password-encryption` = dont encrypt future passwords, but already encrypted passwords will remain
		- `enable secret password_here` = dont display password, stronger
	- `do` = privileged mode commands while in config mode
	- `no` = disables a command which is turned on
	- `hostname host_name_here` 

## Ethernet LAN Switching
- Ethernet frame header and trailer
	- Preamble (7) and SFD (1) - synchronization / start parsing here
	- Destination and Source MAC (6)
	- EtherType (2) - what is the type of PACKET is the PAYLOAD.
	- FCS (4) - Data integrity check
		- ethernet FCS: more robust, integrity of headers AND payload
		- ipv4 checksum: basic, integrity of the packet headers ONLY
		- tcp/udp checksum: basic, integrity of the segment headers AND payload
	- frame is minimum 64 bytes
- MAC addresses
	- first 6 hexadeciaml are the OUI (aka manufacturer)
	- packet tracer wants this format: AAAA.BBBB.CCCC
	- dynamic MACs are removed from mac address-table after 5 minutes of inactivity
	- mac address-table: maps MAC → egress interface
	- `show mac address-table`
	- `clear mac address-table dynamic`
- ARP
	- arp table: maps local IP addresses → mac addresses
		- PCs: `arp -a`
		- CISCO devices: `show arp`
	- arp request: Destination MAC = FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
		- when router receives FFFF.FF... → flood
		- when host receives FFF.FF.... → check if dest IP matches my own IP
			- yes? send ARP reply
			- no? drop
	- ping always sends 5 ICMP echos. 
		- the first 1/5 may fail if MAC unknown, so needs to do an ARP
- Packet tracer quirk:
	- 'noise' like CDP frames every 60 seconds and BDPU frames are not shown

## IPv4 addresses
- 2 hex = 1 byte = 8 bits
- SWITCH: manually setting IP addresses
	- [router#] `show interfaces g0/0` details of 1 interface
	- [router#] `show ip interface brief` shows ip address per interface
		- `do sh ip in br` from config mode
		- status column: admin down / cable unplugged (Down) / both ok (Up)
		- protocol column: down = bad cabling or other side down. up = working
	- [router(config)#] `interface g0/0` = enter configuration for a specific interface
	- [router(config-if)#] `ip address x.x.x.x y.y.y.y` = set the ip address and subnet mask
	- [router(config-if)#] `no shutdown` = switch on a administratively down interface
	- [router(config-if)#] `desc text goes here` = add human readable description
- ROUTER: manually setting IP addresses
	- [switch#] `show ip interface brief` still works here
		- switch interfaces are up by default, whereas router interfaces are admin down by default
	- [switch#] `show interfaces status`
	- [switch(conf)#] `interface f0/1` / `interface f0/1 - 5`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `speed ?` / `speed 10` / `speed 100` / `speed auto`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `duplex auto` / `duplex full` / `duplex half`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `desc textGoesHere`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `shutdown` / `no shutdown`
