## Interfaces and Cables
- 802.3 = Ethernet
- Ethernet cables
	- AKA "Twisted-pair cables" AKA "UTP/STP" AKA "Copper straight-through" (packet tracer)
	- Electric signals
	- maximum length = 100m
	- 10BASE and 100 Base pins (only uses 4/8 wires)
		- Straight-Through
		- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20251003021314.png|260x100]]
		- Crossover
		- ![[image-14.png|268x100]]
		- Switches are the only devices who transmit on 3/6 and receive on 1/2
		- Auto MDI-X means we dont have to worry about using straight-through or crossover
	- 1000BASE and 10GBASE
		- Every pair is bi-directional
		- ![[image-15.png|210x102]]
- Fiber Optic
	- For distances over 100m
	- Light signals
	- Require a transceiver to plug into port
	- MMF vs SMF
		- MMF cheaper
			- bc LED transceivers vs Laser transceivers
		- SMF longer distances

## OSI Model & TCP/IP
- in packet tracer
	- G on interface = "gigabit ethernet"
	- F on interface = "fast ethernet"
- Misunderstandings
	- devices are not members of networks, their interfaces are
	- devices dont have IP addresses, their interfaces do
