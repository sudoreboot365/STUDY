## Interfaces and Cables
- 802.3 = Ethernet
- Ethernet cables
	- AKA "Twisted-pair cables" AKA "UTP/STP" AKA "Copper straight-through" (packet tracer)
	- Electric signals
	- maximum length = 100m
	- 10BASE and 100 Base pins (only uses 4/8 wires)
		- Straight-Through
		- ![[attachments/Pasted image 20251003021314.png|260x100]]
		- Crossover
		- ![[image-14.png|268x100]]
		- Switches are the only devices who transmit on 3/6 and receive on 1/2
		- Auto MDI-X means we dont have to worry about using straight-through or crossover
	- 1000BASE and 10GBASE
		- Every pair is bi-directional
		- ![[image-15.png|210x102]]
- Fiber Optic
	- For distances over 100m
	- Light signals
	- Require a transceiver to plug into port
	- MMF vs SMF
		- MMF cheaper
		- SMF longer distances

## OSI Model & TCP/IP
- in packet tracer
	- G on interface = "gigabit ethernet"
	- F on interface = "fast ethernet"
- Misunderstandings
	- devices are not members of networks, their interfaces are
	- devices dont have IP addresses, their interfaces do

## Cisco IOS CLI
- Rollover cable (serial ↔ rj-45) + Console port + PuTTY (connection type: serial)
- `>` = exec mode
- `#` = privileged mode
	- `enable`/`disable` = enter/exit
	- `show running-config` / `sh run`
	- `show startup-config`
	- `write` / `write memory` / `copy running-config startup-config` = save as startup-config
- `?` = see available commands
- `configure terminal` / `conf t`= enter configuration mode
	- `exit` = exit global conf mode
	- passwords
		- `enable password password_here`
		- `service password-encryption` = dont display password, but weak
			- `no service password-encryption` = dont encrypt future passwords, but already encrypted passwords will remain
		- `enable secret password_here` = dont display password, stronger
	- `do` = privileged mode commands while in config mode
	- `no` = disables a command which is turned on
	- `hostname host_name_here` 

## Ethernet LAN Switching
- Ethernet frame header and trailer
	- Preamble (7) and SFD (1) - synchronization / start parsing here
	- Destination and Source MAC (6)
	- EtherType (2) - what is the type of PACKET is the PAYLOAD.
	- FCS (4) - Data integrity check
		- ethernet FCS: more robust, integrity of headers AND payload
		- ipv4 checksum: basic, integrity of the packet headers ONLY
		- tcp/udp checksum: basic, integrity of the segment headers AND payload
	- frame is minimum 64 bytes
- MAC addresses
	- first 6 hexadeciaml are the OUI (aka manufacturer)
	- packet tracer wants this format: AAAA.BBBB.CCCC
	- dynamic MACs are removed from mac address-table after 5 minutes of inactivity
	- mac address-table: maps MAC → egress interface
	- `show mac address-table`
	- `clear mac address-table dynamic`
- ARP
	- arp table: maps local IP addresses → mac addresses
		- PCs: `arp -a`
		- CISCO devices: `show arp`
	- arp request: Destination MAC = FFFF.FFFF.FFFF
		- when switch receives FFFF.FF... → flood
		- when host receives FFF.FF.... → check if dest IP matches my own IP
			- yes? send ARP reply
			- no? drop
	- ping always sends 5 ICMP echos. 
		- the first 1/5 may fail if MAC unknown, so needs to do an ARP
- Packet tracer quirk:
	- 'noise' like CDP frames every 60 seconds and BDPU frames are not shown

## IPv4 addresses
- 2 hex = 1 byte = 8 bits
- SWITCH: manually setting IP addresses
	- [router#] `show interfaces g0/0` details of 1 interface
	- [router#] `show ip interface brief` shows ip address per interface
		- `do sh ip in br` from config mode
		- status column: admin down / cable unplugged (Down) / both ok (Up)
		- protocol column: down = bad cabling or other side down. up = working
	- [router(config)#] `interface g0/0` = enter configuration for a specific interface
	- [router(config-if)#] `ip address x.x.x.x y.y.y.y` = set the ip address and subnet mask
	- [router(config-if)#] `no shutdown` = switch on a administratively down interface
	- [router(config-if)#] `desc text goes here` = add human readable description
- ROUTER: manually setting IP addresses
	- [switch#] `show ip interface brief` still works here
		- use this for ip, status, and protocol
		- switch interfaces are up by default, whereas router interfaces are admin down by default
	- [switch#] `show interfaces status`
		- use this for vlan, duplex, speed
	- [switch#] `show interfaces` / `show interfaces g0/1` 
		- use this to show errors
	- [switch(conf)#] `interface f0/1` / `interface range f0/1 - 5`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `speed ?` / `speed 10` / `speed 100` / `speed auto`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `duplex auto` / `duplex full` / `duplex half`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `desc textGoesHere`
	- [switch(conf-if)#] `shutdown` / `no shutdown`
- Duplex
	- devices connected to hubs must use half-duplex
	- auto-negoatiate: will set half for 10/100 mbps, but full for 1000 mbps
	- CSMA/CD = avoids collisions on half-duplex

## IPv4 Headers
- Version (4) - 4 or 6
- IHL - header length 
	- Usually just 5 which means "no optional headers"
- DHSCP - QoS flags
- ECN
	- congested receiving router marks incoming L3 packets with ECN=11 "i'm congested!"
	- receving host marks replies with L4 TCP segments with ECE=1 "slow down!"
	- sending host marks subsequent L4 TCP segments with CWD=1 "understood, slowing down!"
- Total Length (headers+payload)
	- min 20
	- max 65,535
- Identification - The original segment which this is fragment belongs to
	- MTU = 1500 bytes
	- can be 1,2,3... or completely randomized for security
- Flags
	- 000 = unfragmented, but allowed
	- 010 = unfragmented, not allowed
	- 001 = fragmented, with more to come
	- 000 = fragmented, last one
- Offset
	- where this fragment belongs in the original datagram
	- divided by 8 bytes to save space
- TTL
	- routers drop if TTL=0
	- TTL is hopcount, decreased by 1 at every router.
	- recommend default TTL is 64
- Protocol
	- TCP (6)
	- UDP (17)
	- Control: ICMP (1), IGMP
	- Routing protocols: OSPF (89), EIGRP
	- VPN/tunneling: GRE, ESP, AH
- Header checksum
- Source IP
- Destination IP

## IPv4 Routing
- WAN = think of a set of routers
- host IPs vs network IPs
	- host IPs = 192.168.1.N, some host bit
	- network IPs = 192.168.1.0, host bit is 0
		- can be an entire LAN
		- can be just the p2p link between 2 routers
- [router#] `show ip route` = show routing table
- When you set IP adress on any interface (`interface g0/1` → `ip address nnn.nnn.n.h\24...` → `no shutdown`) you always get 2 entries added to routing table
	- `C nnn.nnn.n.0\24` = any address of sharing same network address, dont look for next hop IP, go straight to ARP table
	- `L nnn.nnn.n.h\32` = here to route to myself

## Static routes
![[image-16.png|446x90]]

|                              | Destination                                    | Next Hop                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| entry on R1's routing table: | to reach blue network<br>192.168.**4.0**/24    | the next hop is blue IP<br>192.168.**13.3**/24 |
| entry on R4's routing table: | to reach the red network<br>192.168.**1.0**/24 | the next hop is red IP<br>192.168.**34.3**/24  |

- [Router(config)#] `ip route [destination-ip] [subnet mask] [next hop ip]`
	- the entry will have `S` for static
- [Router(config)#] `ip route [destination-ip] [subnet mask] [exit interface]`
	- good for p2p connections between routers, but may create unnecessary ARP traffic if that exit interface leads to multiple subnets
- Default gateway is just when destination IP = `0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0`
	- its just the least specific route possible

## Troubleshooting
- on PC: check `ipconfig /all`
- on PC: try `ping default-gateway`
- on router: check interfaces with `show ip int brief`
- on router: check routing table with `show ip route`
	- cancel a static entry: `no ip route...`

## Subnetting

| **block size** | **decimal** | **CIDR** |
| ---------- | ------- | ---- |
| 128        | 128     | + /1 |
| 64         | 192     | + /2 |
| 32         | 224     | + /3 |
| 16         | 240     | + /4 |
| 8          | 248     | + /5 |
| 4          | 252     | + /6 |
| 2          | 254     | + /7 |
| 1          | 255     | + /8 |

- how to calculate subnet address
	- from weird octave, find block size.
	- keep adding block size to self until exceeds
- `/30` is best subnet mask for p2p networks betwene 2 routers

- subnet1: 192.168.5.0/25
	- pc1: 192.168.5.1  255.255.255.128
	- r1 interface: 192.168.5.126 255.255.255.128 
- subnet2: 192.168.5.128/26
	- pc2: 192.168.5.129 255.255.255.192
	- r2 interface: 192.168.5.190 255.255.255.192
- subnet3: 192.168.5.192/28
	- pc3: 192.168.5.193 .240
	- r3: 192.168.5.206 .240
- subnet4: 192.168.5.208/28
	- pc4: 192.168.5.209 .240
	- r4: 192.168.5.222 .240
- subnet5: 192.168.5.224/30
	-  for 2 P2P interfaces

- purpose of subnetting
	- grouping hosts by shared network bits (instead of say sequentailly) so the route to them can be collectively listed as a single entry in routing table
	- packets to other hosts in same subnet do not need to go up to router. can directly ARP / only go to the switch
## VLANs
- LAN = single broadcast domain (dest MAC = FFFF.FFFF.FFFF)
- cuts down on broadcast traffic
	- ARP, DHCP DOTA, STP BDPUs, CDP/LLDP, IPv6 neighbor discovery (AKA ARP)
		- ARP 2-5 minute timeout
		- DHCP renew least halfway through 12 hour lease default
		- BDPU is every 2 seconds  per switch port (and also per VLAN for trunk ports)
		- CDP every 60s, LLDP every 30s
- VLANs are configured on SWITCH interfaces. the host has no idea what VLAN its on
- `show vlan brief`
- `vlan 10` → `name name_here`
- `interface range g1/0 - 3` → `switchport mode access` → `switchport access vlan 10`
- there are always 5 default vlans (4 are deprecated)
- trunk ports = tagged ports
- access ports = untagged ports
- trunking protocol (802.1Q AKA dot1q)
	- 16bit tag between 'source MAC' and 'EtherType' field
	- TPID {tag protocol indentifier} = 16 bits fixed. 0x8100. "this is a 802.1Q frame"
	- TCI {tag control information}
		- PCP {priority code point} = 3bits. CoS {class of service} AKA congested networks
		- DEI {drop eligiible indicator}= 1bit, can be dropped if congestion
		- VID {vlan id} = 12 bits. 
			- 2^12 = 4096, only 4094 useable
			- 1-1005 : normal VLANs
			- 1006-4094 : extended VLANs
- Native VLANS
	- trunk ports add VLAN tags for all VLANs EXCEPT for the native vlan (1, by default)
- Setup
	- `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`
	- `switchport mode trunk`
- Check
	- `do show interfaces trunk`  ← trunk ports
	- `do show vlan brief` ← access ports
- Configure
	- `switchport trunk allowed vlan (num/add num/remove #)
		- `#` can look like `1-5,10`
	- `switchport trunk native vlan #`
- Router on a stick
	- trunk port connecting to a single physical router interface
	- that router interface must be split into sub-interfaces
	- `interface g0/0.10`
	- `encapsulation dot1q 10` or `encapsulation dot1q 10 native`
	- `ip address [last-usable-address-of-subnet] [mask]`
	- `do show ip interface brief`

2 mistakes i made on lab:
- even after doing `no shutdown` on subinterfaces, still need to do it on the parent
- even after doing `switchport trunk allowed vlan #` on a trunk port, still need to create all vlans on it with `vlan #`

- On Router
	- delete subinterface: `no interface g0/0.10`
	- restore original interface: `default interface g0/0`
- On Switch
	- `default interface g0/0`
	- `ip routing` (enables layer 3 routing) 
	- `interface g0/1` → `no switchport` (changes from layer 2 to layer 3 port) → `ip address ....`
	- set up SVIS
		- `interface vlan 10`
		- `ip address ....`

## Lab 18
- changing 'Switch ↔ ROAS' to 'layer 3 switch ↔ router (p2p)'
	- routers interface
		- delete subinterfaces `no interface g0/0.10`
		- assign IP to parent interface
	- swithc interface
		- set to default `default interface g1/0/2`
		- make into layer 3: `no switchport` →  assign ip
		- set default gateway to router: `ip routing` → `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 next-hop`
			- check: `do show ip route`
	- set up SVIs inside switch
		- check: `do show vlan brief`
		- create SVI: `interface vlan 10` + assign ip + `no shutdown`

## DTP/VTP
- DTP = dynamic trunking protocol
	- auto negotiate if trunk/acess port
	- `switchport mode dynamic desriable`: access ⇔ other side `switchport mode access`
		- "actively tries to trunk unless explicitly refused"
	- `switchport mode dynamic auto:` trunk if (1) `switchport mode trunk` or (2) `switchport mode dynamic desirable`
		- "only trunk if other side tries to trunk"
	- 2 notes:
		- ports to ROAS must still be set manually with `switch mode trunk`
		- disabling it: `switchport nonegotiate`
		- DTP also negotiates whether dot1q or isl
- VTP = VLAN trunking protocol.
	- configure vlans on only 1 central switch
	- if servers add/modify/delete VLANS, then update revision number + store in NVRAM + advertise over trunks to clients, who advertise to other clients
		- advertisements limited to VTP domains
		- if a client with no domain name (null) receives advertisement, will automatically join that domain
	- problem: connect old switch with high revision number
	- transparent mode: forwards advertisements if same domain, but not does forward its own or sync
	- versions
		- v2 can use token ring VLANs (obsolete)
		- v3 
	- 2 ways to reset revision number to 0
		- change to unused domain name
		- change to `vtp mode transparent`

## STP minor facts
- True STP
	- BDPUs advertise out of all ports: "I can reach `root_id` (both name and rank) with `root_cost` via port `root_port`
	- if a switch receives a BDPU s.t. `root_id_New` < `root_id` on `port_New`, who has a cost to root of `root_cost_New` connected via cable with `cost_New`, update and begin advertising this new BDPU
		- `root_id` ← `root_id_B`
		- `root_cost` ← `root_cost_New` + `cost_New`
		- `root_port` ← `port_New`
- Misc
	- Default port ID = `0x8001` = default port priority 80 =8x16^1 + 0x16^0 , + port ID 1
	- Default bridge ID = 32769 = 32768 (2^15 default bridge priority) + 1 (default VLAN ID)
		- bridge priority is multiples of multiples of 4096
		- higher VLAN is 4095
	- Spanning tree = 802.1D
- States
	- Blocking
		- dont send traffic, don't forward BDPUs, don't learn MAC addresses
	- Listening
		- 15s - same except starts sending BDPUs
	- Learning
		- 15s - same except learns MAC addresses from regular traffic
- BPDUs
	- a bridge which believes itself ot be hte root sends these out every 2 seconds
	- a bridge which doesnt believe itself to be hte root is dormant until it receives a BDPU (which ultimatley originated from a root bridge's hello BPDU)
	- only forwarded on designated ports!
	- if doesnt receive a BPDU for 10x2sec, re-assumes self ot be root bridge
	- BDPUs always have MAC address of 
		- STP: 01:80:C2:00:00:00
		- PVST+: 01:00:0C:CC:CC:CD
		- special multicast group for switches (end hosts dont get it, and also dont forward out like broadcasts)
- Other options
	- portfast - ports to end hosts still need to go through listening and learning... 50s wasted. 
		- interface → `spanning-tree portfast`
			- or for ROAS: `spanning-tree portfast trunk` 
	- bpdu guard - disabled if receive any bdpu
		- interface → `spanning-tree bpduguard enable`
		- violation causes `err-disabled` state: 
			- `shutdown` → `no shutdown`
			- `errdisable recovery cause bdpuguard`
	- set both as defualts on all access ports
		- `spanning-tree portfast default`
		- `spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default`
	- bpdu filter - dont send unncessary bpdu traffic to end hosts
- Configurations
	- `spanning-tree mode pvst/rapid-pvst`
	- set root bridge: switch → `spanning-tree vlan 1 root primary/secondary`

## Root Guard
- purpsoe: makes sure another bridge with lower bridge ID doesnt take over
- if root guard enabled port receives a BPDU, it enters "broken - root inconsistent" state until the admin of the erronenous root switch to change its bridge ID
- interface → `spanning-tree guard root`

## Loop Guard
- purpose: disables a port if it stops receving BPDUs (so it doenst go into forwarding)
- bad situation: unidirectional links
	- happens with fiberoptic between 2 switches because they have separate tx and rx
	- there will be a loop in the direction in which tx still occurs
	- if max age timer reaches 0, "broken - loop inconsistent" instead of changing to designated
- Comparison
	- Loop guard prevents things accidentally becoming designated
	- Root guard prevents things accidentally becoming root ports
	- if both configured?
		- the one configred on port overrides one configured globally
		- or the one configured most latest overrides

## RSTP
- blocking becomes discarding
- listening state deleted
- nondiscarding → alternate
	- purpose: if root fails, alternate becomes root immediately
	- ![[image-19.png|116x79]]
- nondiscarding → backup
	- redudant port on the same switch as an active designated port 
	- ![[image-18.png|116x82]]
	- which wil be desig and which will be backup? the lower port ID
- uplinkfast & backbone fast:
	- description: makes blocking → forwarding immediately
	- both built into RSTP by default

## STP Fundamentals
- Root Bridge ID
	- Crtieria 1. bridge ID = bridge priority + VLAN
	- Tiebreaker 2. mac address
- Cost of a path
	- Criteria 1. sum of link costs
		- STP: E/Fa/G/Te = 100/19/4/2 (STP) = 2x10^6/5/4/3 (RSTP)
	- Tiebreaker 2: neighbors bridge ID
	- Tiebreaker 3: neighbor port ID
		- only comes into play if parallel links
- root port
	- 1 per SWITCH
	- logically: port with lowest cost path to the root
	- visually: points INWARDS/TOWARDS root
	- problem solving:
		- most of the time
		- 1 case when it can get hard
			- 1. 2 cables between switches
			  ![[image-24.png|244x112]] → ![[image-21.png|254x114]] 
			  tiebreaker. port with lower *NEIGHBOR* port ID → root port
- designated port
	- 1 per SEGMENT
	- logically: port with lowest cost path to the root
	- visually: points OUTWARDS/AWAY FROM root
	- problem solving in practice:
		- 3 cases when its easy
			- 1. all ports on root bridge = always designated
			- 2. after determining root port, port opposite = always designated
			- 3. ports going to end hosts = always designated
		- hard case #1: segments left after determining all root ports
			- ![[image-22.png|219x148]] → ![[image-23.png|219x147]]
			- red segment has same cost both ways, so tiebreaker:
			- port on switch with *LOWER* bridge ID will become designated
		- hard case #2: switch has 2 connections to a hub
			  ![[image-26.png|125x131]] → ![[image-20.png|130x131]]
			  port w *LOWER* port ID = designated

## STP CLI
- abort = ctrl + shift + 6
- switch: `show spanning-tree`
- connects to switch
	- interface: `spanning-tree link-type point-to-point`
- connects to end host / edge port
	- interface: `spanning-tree portfast`
	- packet tracker only shows `p2p` but real IOS will show both p2p and `edge`
	- any conenctions to a hub will show `shr` which means half duplex

## EtherChannel
- problem
	- need to increase bandwidth between 2 switches, but if we use multiple links, STP will blocks
- Many names
	- etherchannel = port channel = link aggregation group (LAG)
- CLI
	- check load-balancing method:
		- `show etherchannel load-balance`
	- change load-balancing method: 
		- `port-chanel load-balance <method-name>`
		- method-name = {`src-dst-ip`, `src-dst-mac`, `src-ip`, `dst-mac`, etc}
	- create a virtual interface using etherchannel: 
		- interface range: `channel-group <#> mode <method>`
		- group# = 1
		- method = {`auto`, `desirable` (PAgP), `active`, `passive` (LACP), `on` (static)}
			- "auto + auto" = no etherchannel, all other situations = yes
			- "passive + passive" = no etherchannel, all other situations = yes
			- "on + on" = etherchannel, all other situations = no
	- select the created etherchannel:
		- `interface po#`
	- 1. configure it as a trunk:
		- `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`
		- `switchport mode trunk`
	- 2. configure it as layer 3:
		- `no switchport`
		- `ip address xx.xx nn.nn`
	- show/check changes:
		- `show etherchannel summary`
			- (P) = part of port-channel
			- (S) = layer 2
			- (R) = layer 3
			- (s) = suspended 
- EtherChannel methods
	- PAgP (port aggregation protocol)
		- cisco proprietary
		- dynamically creates/maintains etherchannels (like DTP does for trunks)
	- LACP (link aggregation control protocol)
		- AKA 802.3ad
		- can form with switches of other vendors
	- Static EtherChannel
- Facts
	- up to 8 can be used
	- all physical interfaces in a etherchannel group must have the same speed, duplex, access/trunk mode, and VLANs allowed (if trunk)

## Dynamic routing
- network route  = any ip address with subnet mask less than /32
- host route = any ip address with subnet mask /32
- ECMP = equal cost multi path (load balancing)
- internal vs external gateway protocol
  ![[image-27.png|284x126]]
- distance vector
	- destination ip → next hop + total distance to dest
- link state
	- every router has connectivity map of whole network
- metrics
	- RIP = hop count. all links = 1
	- EIGRP = f(bandwidth of slowest link, delay of all links)
	- OSPF = sum of bandwidth costs of each link7
- administrative distance 
	- direct = 0
	- static = 1
	- BGP = 20
	- EIGRP = 90
	- IGRP = 100
	- OSPF = 110
	- IS-IS = 115
	- RIP = 120
	- unusable = 255
- RIP
	- max 15 hops
	- share routing tables every 30s
	- RIPv1
		- only class A, B, C (therefore subnet masks assumed)
		- broadcasts to 255.255.255.255
	- RIPv2
		- can do CIDR addresses
		- multicast to 224.0.0.9
		- 
	- CLI 
		- `router rip` → `version 2` → `no auto-summary`
		- ports we WANT rip on: `network 10.0.0.0` (advertises the routing tables of all interfaces which match `10.0.0.0/8`)
		- ports we DONT WANT rip on: `passive-interface g2/0` (only receive RIPs there, dont send)
		- advertise the way to the internet: 
			- `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 x.x.x.x`
			- `default-information originate`
		- check stuff: `show ip protocols`
- EIGRP
	- can do UNEQUAL cost load balancing
	- mutlicast to 224.0.0.10
	- use letter `D` in routing table and admin distance 90
	- `router eigrp <as#>` → `no auto-summary`
		- network can have no subnet mask → assume classful subnet mask
		- or use subnetmask → use inverted
			- ex. 255.255.255.240 → 0.0.0.15
			- just subtract from 255
