- OSI
	- interface BETWEEN web browser and network = application layer
- CISCO CLI
	- `end` = back to priv exec mode
	- `exit` = back 1 level
	- `enable secret <password>` encrypts as MD5
	- `service password-encryption` encrypts (both current and future) plain-text passwords set by `enable password <password>`
- IPv4
	- "total length" header = entire packet length
	- if min # hosts per subnet is 16, need 5 host bits, not 4, because 1 broadcast and 1 network address
- Router interfaces
	- router interfaces are "down/down" by default"
	- interfaces
		- speed mismatch = down/down
		- duplex mismatch = up/up, but collisions + CRC + drops
- Routing
	- recursive static route =  points to an IP, not exit interface
	- proxy arp = a router answers ARP on behalf of an end host
- Ridiculous CCNA-specific nuances
	- "ARP" is considered to be hte DORA process, not the mapping process
	- "between" the web browser and network is application layer
